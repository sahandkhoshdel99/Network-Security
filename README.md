# Network-Security

I passed this course as on of my elective course (mainly in Computer Engineering's) program. It's main focus was on introducing the **cryptographic basis of popular protocols** and **algorithms invovled** in them such as RSA, SSL/TLS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, WEP, WPA(all versions), etc.
