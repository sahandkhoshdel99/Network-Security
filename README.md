# Network-Security

I passed this course as on of my elective course (mainly in Computer Engineering's) program. It's main focus was on introducing the **cryptographic basis of popular protocols** and **algorithms invovled** in them such as: RSA, SSL/TLS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, WEP, WPA(all versions), etc. Moreover, we gained knowledge about security in each layer of computer networks, inlovlving how diffferent types of **VPN connections** work, **Firewalls** and their configuration tables, and also how different types of malware, phishing attacks and other potential threats can damage a network and access, modify, stop and reroute data.
