# Network-Security

I passed this course as on of my elective course (mainly in Computer Engineering's) program. It's main focus was on introducing the **cryptographic basis of popular protocols** and **algorithms invovled** in them such as: **RSA, SSL/TLS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, WEP, WPA** (all versions), etc. Moreover, we gained knowledge about security in each layer of computer networks, inlovlving how diffferent types of **VPN connections** work, **Firewalls** and their configuration tables, and also how different types of malware, phishing attacks and other potential threats can damage a network and access, modify, stop and reroute data. 

## Computer Assignemnts
Computer Assignemnts consist of 3 assignments which the second one was related to email security and done via microsoft outlook involving digital signatures, and mail configurations, and as a result, there's no such kind of report or code available for it.

The first computer assignment is an **implementation of the primary RSA system** , which is coded in **python**. 

the third assignment's goal was to design an **OAuth** system via GitHub's servers granting **client credential** access through a **simple login page** writeten in **HTML**, which was itself coded in **JavaScript**. 


## Analytical Assignemnts
Analytical Assignments cover a wide variety of topics teached in the course.
