## Federated Learning and Privacy Preserving ML

This project is a survey presentation I have done with my collaborators Hamid Salemi, and Mehdi Zarei. It mainly about how **Federated Learning** and more specifically, **Secure Aggreagtion**(Originally presented by Google in ACM 2017)tackle privacy issues in large and distributed ML system, and also about challenges **GANs** and **Gradient Learning** can produce in such systems. 

The **Slides** are in **English** but the **Report** is unfortunalely in **Persian**. Although it can be translated and presented upon request.
